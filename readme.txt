== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

When you place the shortcode a post_id gets generated using the uid you passed. This id is used to mimic a post or page and insert a comment form and the comments.

= Using a post_id, will it conflict with the comments of the existing posts/pages? =

No, the generated id is such a large number, you would have to write millions of posts.
